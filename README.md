# SPARK-Addition
SPARK-Addition is a program designed to search for spatial variable genes, which is a hot topic in bioinformatics. Based on SPARK, the program improved the kernel function presenting the spatial expression patterns and modified the calculation rules of P-value. This makes SPARK-Addition perform better than the original SPARK.

We put all the data in ./data, original codes in ./analysis,  outputs in ./output, plots and related generating codes in ./plot, simulation generating code in ./simulation, and we also give a complex version of our program in ./plus. For your information, GPML is needed to put in ./plus to make the complex program work.
